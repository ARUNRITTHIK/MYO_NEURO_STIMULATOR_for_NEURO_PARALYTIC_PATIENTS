# 3.) A PATENT is published for this product

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to the field of health care  product  application in providing assistance to neuro paralytic patients with the  introduction of “IoT Based Automated External  Muscle And Nerve (Myo Neuro) Stimulator” where  patient  musculo skeletal system can be put in active form helping for locomotion  if done at regular intervals.

The embodiment comprises of the following components :

1.Microcontroller - AT-Mega32 will control and act as the brain for the system. It instructs the other components to do their work.

2.Real Time Controller - The time period that the patient has to take an exercise is obtained from this RTC module, which gives the real time to the controller.

3.DC motor & Driver module - Direct current motor is used to move the parts of the patient and controller will control the direction and speed of the motor.

4.Shafts - Shafts that are connected with the motor and the patients’ part to move in the required direction

5.Li-Po battery - It gives the power required for the controller and motor. This battery is lightweight and used in many projects.

6.Speaker - Speakers are one of the most common output devices used with computer systems. Some speakers are designed to work specifically with computers, while others can be   hooked up to any type of sound system. Regardless of their design, the purpose of speakers is to produce audio output that can be heard by the listener.

7.SD Card module - The micro- SD Card Module is a simple solution for transferring data to and from a standard SD card. The pin out is directly compatible with Arduino, but can also be used with other microcontrollers. It allows you to add mass storage and data logging to your project. This module has SPI interface which is compatible with any sd card and it use 5V or 3.3V power supply which is compatible with Arduino UNO/Mega. SD module has various applications such as data logger, audio, video, graphics. This module will greatly expand the capability an Arduino can do with their poor limited memory.

8.GSM - A GSM module or a GPRS module is a chip or circuit that will be used to establish communication between a mobile device or a computing machine and a GSM or GPRS system. A GSM modem can be a dedicated modem device with a serial, USB or Bluetooth connection, or it can be a mobile phone that provides GSM modem capabilities.

9.Voice Recognition Module - Voice Recognition Module is a compact easy voice control speaking recognition board. It is a speaker dependent module and supports up to 80 voice commands. Any sound could be trained as command. Users need to train the module first before recognizing any voice command. Voice commands are stored in one large group like a library. Any 7 voice commands in the library could be imported into recognizer. It means 7 commands are effective at the same time. This board has 2 controlling ways: Serial Port (full function), General Input Pins (part of function). General Output Pins on the board could generate several kinds of waves while corresponding voice commands were recognized.

10.Blink Sensor Based Communication module - This module involves CNY 70 IR transmitter (Blink Sensor) which includes infrared emitter and phototransistor which blocks visible light. The transmitter transmits IR rays into the eye of patients. Depending on whether the eye is closed or open, there will be value 0 for closed eye and 1 for open eye. The transmitted signal is captured by the IR receiver. Then the receiver data is transmitted and analyzed using simple Machine Learning technique to identify the variation in blinking and based on that it will trigger the GSM module.
