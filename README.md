With a vast development and latest technological advancement in mechatronics, prosthetic devices have acquired interest in many  fields  like medical and industrial fields. A prosthetic device can be an external wearable mobile machine that covers the body or part of it. It is generated by pneumatics and electric motors. It can be installed on an upper and lower limb. Moreover, it can be used for different purposes such as rehabilitation, power assistance, diagnostics, monitoring based on  its ergonomical designed  structure  etc. Most of the existing wearable devices face different problems in terms of size, cost and weight. They are huge, expensive and heavy. Therefore, the aim  of this project is to design a portable, lightweight and low cost effective  rehabilitative wearable device  system for people with a  neuro paralyzed  weakness in both limbs. The wearable device allows the user to perform specific movements and  various range of exercising pattern  to train the patient's impaired limbs. Thus, the user gradually starts to restore the functionality of his limb.

This paper presents a feasibility study of a brain machine interface system to assist repetitive facilitation exercise. Repetitive facilitation exercise is an effective rehabilitation method for patients with monoplegia, hemiplegia and even quadriplegia too. In repetitive facilitation exercise, a therapist stimulates the paralyzed   limb part of the patient while motor commands run along the nerve pathway. However, successful repetitive facilitation exercise is difficult to achieve and even a skilled practitioner cannot detect when a motor command occurs in a patient's brain. We proposed a brain machine interface system for automatically detecting motor commands and stimulating the paralyzed limb part of a patient. To determine motor commands from patient electroencephalogram (EEG) data, we measured the movement related cortical potential (MRCP) and constructed a support vector machine system. In this paper, we validated the prediction timing of the system at the highest accuracy by the system using EEG and MRCP. In the experiments, we measured the EEG when the participant bent their elbow when prompted to do so. We analyzed the EEG data using a cross validation method. We found that the average accuracy was 72.9% and the highest at the prediction timing 280 ms. We conclude that 280 ms is the most suitable to predict the judgment that a patient intends to exercise or not.
